This repository contains multiple modular GCP infrastructure deployments using **Terraform**. Each **branch** represents a specific assignment with regionally separated network architectures, VM customization scripts, and cloud automation practices. **Resources are added weekly to progressively build out the entire GCP network architecture‚Äîstarting with authentication and backend configuration, then expanding through VPCs, subnets, NAT, firewall rules, and compute resources. The build culminates in the deployment of managed instance groups, autoscaling policies, regional HTTP load balancer, health checks, and multi-zone traffic distribution.**
